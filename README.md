# Welcome to the Curiosity Kindler!

In an answer-overloaded world, I hope this project can serve as a question-oriented ponderspace for curious minds. Whether you're a writer, teacher, student, interviewer, interviewee, coach, therapist, new friend, new lover, or just someone looking to stretch your mind, I hope these questions can spark some exciting thoughts.

Based on three variables (tone selection, intensity selection, text input), I query an AI model to pose five questions guided by a philosophy of what (I think) makes a good, critical question. 

## What makes a good question?

As instucted to the AI model: A good question is open-ended, inviting multiple valid perspectives. Rather than focusing on who, what, when, or where, it emphasizes why or how, exploring patterns, themes, purpose, contradictions, significance, or theory. Questions can be intense but should never make someone feel attacked or defensive. Answers may draw on personal reflection as well as broader ideas. Your goal is to engage your conversation partner emotionally and intellectually, encouraging exploration, reflection, and possibly a shift in perspective. Be creative and curious. And please don't use too many big, sophisticated, convoluted words; the goal is to be concise, clear, and digestible to a curious teenager. 

## Tone selection

A personal tone draws on history, observations, feelings, or values. 
A theoretical tone is abstract, focusing on concepts and philosophy. 
Practical questions explore day-to-day experiences or social and political dynamics. 
A playful tone is light and humorous, while a formal tone is professional and respectful. 
An absurd tone is unexpected and pushes the boundaries of imagination. 

## Depth selection

Light should generate simple, surface level questions that range from eight to fifteen words. Moderate depth generates moderately challenging questions, averaging around twenty to thirty words. Inferno intensity generates the deepest, hardest, most thought-provoking questions which can be short and punchy, mid length, or as long as fifty words but no longer.

## Text input

The wild wild west for ideas! Although I provided the following message to the AI model: "If you are confused or uncomfortable generating questions from the input itself, I invite you to get metaphysical with you questions (e.g. about the nature of being nonsensical or inappropriate) or exercise your cleverness with another approach to the five questions."

## AI model

For now, I am using the gemini-2.5-flash API. I am not totally locked into this model, and continue to analyze model tradeoffs including the model's bias, environmental impact, transparency, and performance.

## Upcoming features

Including but not limited to:
- Share questions
- Add custom tones
- "Need inspiration?" random generator
- Save/favorite questions
- "More like this question:" Generate new questions based on an outputted question 
- Search history


## I welcome all feedback!

If you have any thoughts or ideas ranging from technical to philosophical to absurd, I'd love to hear. Feel free to shoot me an email at avery@keare.com or send me a message at +1 310 463 7040.
